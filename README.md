Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js
===

## //TODO
I named this application //TODO in reference to the Java comment used to highlight tasks within the code that need to be completed. This application is a simple todo list manager that displays the users todo list (with an included example entry "Homework: Assignment 2" included for demoing purposes). This single-page application also allows users to add tasks to their todo list.

## Technical Achievements
- **Single-Page Application**: By taking the stored appdata from server.js and mapping it to the "todo-list" element in index.html, I was able to render the todo list dynamically on the client side. updateTable() is called in the window.onload function (so any stored data is displayed when the app is opened) and when the user submits a task.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Bootstrap**: I implemented Bootstrap to style the application, specifically for the form elemnents and buttons.
