Assignment 4 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js

## //TODO
Hosting link: https://a4-ashleighperez.glitch.me/

I named this application //TODO in reference to the Java comment used to highlight tasks within the code that need to be completed. This application is a simple todo list manager that displays the users todo list. This single-page application also allows users to add tasks to their todo list. From Assignment 3, I expanded the user login functionality to allow users to create their own login (that version of the app is hosted on the glitch site). On this local version, I broke up the singular index.html page into react components.
